# AI-Powered-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
This is a Cyber Security tool that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor network traffic and identify potential threats i.e, Intrusions occured in the network.
## Implementation Steps
* Set Up Environment: Install dependencies: pip install scapy pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow.
* Collect Data: Use Scapy to sniff packets or load a dataset.
* Preprocess Data: Extract features and label data (e.g., normal vs. attack).
* Train Model: Choose and train an AI model.
* Deploy: Integrate with live packet capture for real-time detection.
